# Data Structures and Algorithms

A testbed for common data structures and algorithms as seen in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures)

The source is on .NET Core. Unit tests in xUnit are in the same project because of the incompatibilities between prerelease tooling and libraries.

## Implemented sorting algorithms
* Quicksort
* Mergesort
* Heapsort
* Bubblesort
* Selectionsort
